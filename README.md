## What it does

It enables users to upload files to a safe online storage, share these files with their friends, find other interesting files uploaded by other users and create rooms for groups, classes or poeple with similar interests to upload files they want to make readily available among all members.

## How I built it

- I used the powerful features of Next.js, ethers.js, web3.storage and some nice react packages like react-loader-spinner, react spring etc.
- I built the Frontend using Next.js, and authentication with Next auth and the Moralis auth API. For smart contract integration I used ethers and Moralis SDK.
- I built the smart contract on the polygon Mumbai chain using solidity, ethers.js and the open zeppelin library.
- I stored files with web3.storage.

## What I learned

It was a lot of fun, i learnt how to make a powerful contract for file storage purposes using NFTS. I learnt about how to integrate my smart contract with the frontend more efficiently by making contract function calls into a sort of api that i can call from the frontend.

I worked with many cool libraries, of note the web3.storage library that enabled mme to upload files to the IPFS and instantly generate a shareable link from it at the same time.

## What's next for Upbox

There's a lot i can do to improve the app, I have plans to improve the UI, add more features that i believe users might need like lliking files, chatting with other users etc.
